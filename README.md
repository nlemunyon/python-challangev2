This work is turned in late becuase I serve in the Marine Corps reserve, and last weekend we had drill. Just with working full time and with drill there was no time to complete the assignment until now. 
While completeing this assignment I had the help of a tutor. He was very helpful in directing me to new resources. I also had the help of a classmate Dalila Santiago, who really helped guide me through the second half of the challenge.
